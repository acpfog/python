# Here I placed my different Python scripts and apps

The folder `6.00.1x_scripts` contains my solutions to exercises for a course "Introduction to programming using Python". 

`dead_email_addresses_parser.py` parses for delivery errors in incoming emails. 
A recipient's address will be saved in DB for further purposes, if the script find an delivery error.
